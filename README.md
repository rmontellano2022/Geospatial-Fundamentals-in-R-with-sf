# Workshop Goals

- __Part I: Core concepts, vector data, and plotting__
      - Basic geospatial concepts
      - Basic vector data
      - Geospatial data structures (the `sf` package)
      - Basic plotting (`base::plot` and the `ggplot3` package)
      - Managing coordinate reference systems (CRS)
      - Advanced plotting (the `tmap` package)
      - Map overlays
  - __Part II: Spatial analysis__
      - Spatial measurement queries
      - Spatial relationship queries
      - Buffer analysis
      - Spatial and non-spatial joins
      - Aggregation
      - Continued mapping practice
  - __Part III: Raster data__
      - Raster concepts
      - Raster data structures (the `raster` package) 
      - Mapping with raster and vector data
      - Spatial analysis of raster and vector data
      - Raster reclassification
      - Raster stacks and raster algebra 


**We assume that participants have working familiarity with the R language, including the topics covered in our [R-Fundamentals workshop](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Fundamentals) materials (though participants without this have still reported useful learning about geospatial concepts).**

# Resources

- The [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) textbook (Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow, 2019) is an excellent resource for getting up and running.
- The [R sf package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) webpage, especially the Articles tab of tutorials for getting started.
- The [`tmap` getting started](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) documentation is a great source of plotting support.
- The [`sf` vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf1.html) and [`sf` cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf) are great resources for developing and debugging `sf` code.
- The [`raster` vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/vignettes/Raster.pdf) should help you troubleshoot that package.


# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services.
